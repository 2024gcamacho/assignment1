# Assignment 1: Python Refresher 

Here is my echo.py code. The comments I wrote were mostly to help myself, since I haven't used python for a couple of semesters. It took me a while to remember the coding conventions of Python, but once that was cleared up, the logic was easy. Looking at the output, I start with printing the original text then I iterate through repetitions, stepping -1 each iteration to achieve the echoing effect. It was a short, simple, and great first Python code to begin the semester with!
